# The Future of the Answer List

The current list is comprised of 2,315 words, 1,692 of which have been used after today's puzzle (2026-02-06). leaving
623 remaining answers from the original list. The last day for the current list will be 2027-10-23 if nothing changes.

There are several other Wordle clones out there using that same original answers list, and there is something to be said
for sticking with it in case people want to compare results to someone playing another game. Also, Sharaz
(@sharazluke@mastodon.world) mentioned a celebration after the complete answer list had been used, which is a really fun
idea.

I am also aware that the NYT, at some point after they took over Wordle, added about 800ish answers to the original list.
I've also seen some answers that maybe should not have been answers, and I'm pretty sure that some of these remain in
the list, as yet unused.

I have arrived at the opinion that consulting a list of previously used answers and eliminating them from consideration
gives a player an unfair advatage - if you remember them, more power to you. And if you want to spend time commiting
the list, or some portion of it, to memory that's up to you. Consulting the list while playing would be similar, in my
mind, to taking notes into a closed book, no notes, exam. All this is to say, I don't think it matters much how many
words remain - as long as there's one.

In writing out my thoughts, I've pretty much arrived at the opinion that we should just leave things as is. Play the
list through its conclusion and have a celebration. As we approach that point we can consider what to do about the next
list.
